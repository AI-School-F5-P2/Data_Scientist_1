        Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the world. It is important to be able to identify people who are at increased risk of stroke so that they can receive appropriate treatment and reduce their risk.

        IctusShield's stroke risk screening application is a valuable tool for doctors and nurses to help assess patients' risk of stroke. The application uses a machine learning model trained on data from stroke and non-stroke patients. The model learns to identify characteristics that are associated with an increased risk of stroke.

        The application is easy to use and requires only a few minutes to complete the assessment. 
             
        **Physicians and nurses can use the app to:**

         -  Assess a patient's stroke risk.
         -  Educate patients about stroke risk factors.
         -  Document a patient's stroke risk.
         -  IctusShield is committed to the health and well-being of patients. Our app is a valuable tool that can help doctors and nurses save lives.

        **Specific benefits for doctors and nurses:**

         -  Helps identify patients at increased risk for stroke.
         -  Provides information on stroke risk factors.
         -  Helps document a patient's risk of stroke.
        
        Try IctusShield's stroke risk detection app today and find out how it can help you save lives.
